    <u>The Information We Collect</u></p>

    authorize us to collect and/or receive such information.</p>
  <p class="headings">
    1.	<u>Contact Information.</u></p>
  <p>
    We do not collect any contact information from you, unless you provide such information voluntarily, such as by registering with us, sending
    us an e-mail, or interacting with us via our social media pages, such as through Facebook.  Any such social media platforms are operated by
    the social networks themselves and are subject to their terms of use and privacy policies.  If you use such third-party social media platforms,
    you are authorizing Weserve.io to collect, store, and use, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, any and all information that you agreed that
    Facebook or such other third parties could provide to us through their application programming interface (“<u>API</u>”).  Such information may

  <p>
    c.	<u>From</u> <u>Cookies</u>.  Information that we collect using “cookie” technology.  Cookies are small packets of data that a website stores on your
    computer’s or mobile device’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your visit.  We may use both session cookies
    (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to help us collect
    Other Information and to enhance your experience using the Site or the Services.  If you do not want us to place a cookie on your hard drive,
    you may be able to turn that feature off on your computer or mobile device.  Please consult your Internet browser’s documentation for
    information on how to do this and how to delete persistent cookies.  However, if you decide not to accept cookies from us, the Site or the
    Services may not function properly.</p>
  <p>
    d.	<u>Third-Party Analytics</u>.
    We may use third-party analytics services (such as Google Analytics) to evaluate use of the Site and the Services, compile reports on
    activity, collect demographic data, analyze performance metrics, and collect and evaluate other information relating to the Site  and the
    Services and mobile and Internet usage.  These third parties use cookies and other technologies to help analyze and provide us the data.
    By accessing and using the Site or the Services, you consent to the processing of data about you by these analytics providers in the manner
    and for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
